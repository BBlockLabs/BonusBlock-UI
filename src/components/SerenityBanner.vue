After this period, participants will have the opportunity to redeem their tokens according to the allocation received.By participating in the campaign, you acknowledge and accept the variation in token distribution depending on the number of participants and agree to the redemption terms set forth after the campaign. Please review all related guidelines and information before participating in the StrongBox testnet campaign.Serenity Shield reserves the right to amend, modify, or update the token distribution mechanism, terms, and conditions of the SERSH token reward pool, at its sole discretion, if necessary.
